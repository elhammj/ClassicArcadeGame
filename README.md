## How does the game work?

The game consists of bugs and a character. Bugs are moving with a random speed. The target is moving the character to the water without hitting bugs. If the character hits the bug and the score greater than 0, the score would be decreased by one and the character returns back to its starting point. If the character reaches the water safely, the score will be increased by one and the character returns back to its starting point. 
	
* Win:
	* When time is out (0 seconds) and the score equal to or greater than (10).
	* The winning screen will show "Congratulations" and allows you to play again. 
* Lose:
	* When time is out and the score less than 10.
	* The lose screen will show "Game Over" and allows you to retry.
