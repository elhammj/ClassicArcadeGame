You have 60 Seconds to complete your game and get 10 scores at least. The goal is the character should reach the water without hitting the bugs. Whenever the bug hits you, your score will be decreased by one. If you reach the water, the score will be increased by one. When time is out (60 seconds) and your score equal or greater than 10, that means you win; otherwise you will see the game over screen, do not give up try again!\nGood luck :)");
